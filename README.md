# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is focused on building a regression model to predict house prices using Zillow house price dataset. The project utilizes both deep neural network and shallow machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

This project is focused on building a regression model to predict house prices using Zillow house price dataset. The project utilizes both deep neural network and shallow machine learning techniques.

## Neural Networks.ipynb

The dataset used in this project is the Zillow House Price dataset, which can be obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about different house features, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location, and the corresponding sale price.

## Regression.ipynb

This notebook contains the implementation of the deep neural network method for the house price prediction task. The notebook starts with the data preprocessing steps, including feature selection, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets. Then, a deep neural network is built and trained using the training set. The performance of the model is evaluated using the testing set, and the results are visualized using various plots.

## Regression.ipynb

This notebook contains the implementation of shallow machine learning models for the house price prediction task. The notebook starts with the data preprocessing steps, similar to the Neural Networks.ipynb notebook. Then, various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression are implemented, and their performances are compared.
